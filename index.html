                    <p align=justify>No team will be attached to more free-agent pitchers this offseason than Texas, which made a big splash last winter with the signings of Corey Seager and Marcus Semien for a combined $500 million. The Rangers are said to be in pursuit of a bona fide ace such as Verlander, though Texas has also been attached to pitchers including deGrom, Kodai Senga and Carlos Rodón.
                    Turns out he looked like a Cy Young winner, capturing his third career award with a superb season.

	   	     <p align=justify>One year ago, Justin Verlander hit the open market with an enormous question mark hovering over his free agency: after making just one start since the beginning of 2020 and undergoing Tommy John surgery, what would the two-time American League Cy Young Award winner look like at the age of 39?</p>
	   	     <p align=justify>Turns out he looked like a Cy Young winner, capturing his third career award with a superb season.</p>

	   	     <p align=justify>Verlander signed a one-year, $25 million deal with the Astros, a contract that included a $25 million player option for 2023 if he pitched at least 130 innings. The right-hander breezed by that mark, but his incredible season led him to decline the option, giving him an opportunity to test the market once again.
	   	     </p>

	   	    <p align=justify> In terms of talent, Verlander is arguably the best starting pitcher on the free-agent market. But he’ll turn 40 in February, an age when most pitchers are looking at a decline and/or retirement. Then again, Verlander might be baseball’s answer to Tom Brady, who won an MVP award at the age of 40 and Super Bowl rings at 41 and 43.</p>
